          <h2> Have 3 kids </h2>
          <p> Growing up as a single child, I always new that someday I will have a big family.
            so as much as it sounds weird, yes! "Have 3 kids" is a project that I'm working on
            (and not an easy one.... trust me). with 2 daughter , I have one more to go :-)

      <div>
        <h2> Learn Emily to ride on bikes</h2>
        <p>
          Emily loves her bikes, but she needs instructions and help so she can feel
          safe and comfrtable. with a 1 year old baby at home it's hard to find time every
          weekend to learn her. So it's a project in process.
